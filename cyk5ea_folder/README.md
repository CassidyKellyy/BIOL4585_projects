## Overview of data
I used data from https://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.79667/allnutrients.csv?sequence=1
 which describes Mean phenotype values for various DGRP (drosophila melanogaster) lines. The complex contributions of genetics and nutrition to immunity in Drosophila melanogaster.

*Interpreation*: The data show that their exist no correlation among high and low levels of glucose.
